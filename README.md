# Welcome to my GitHub repositories 👋
Hi, I'm Michele De Stefano, an experienced data scientist and machine-learning/AI engineer.
I graduated in _Telecommunications Engineering_ at _Politecnico di Milano_ in the first years of this century.
Since then I worked in different fields: **S**ynthetic **A**perture **R**adar (SAR) image processing,
geophysical imaging, video game physics and AI, capacity optimization, photovoltaic plants data processing,
financial data processing. I am also an experienced software engineer, because I always had to implement for
production the new algorithms I devised.

I'm able to program in many languages, most of all C/C++, Python and Java. I'm also passionate about electronics
and I like experimenting with Arduino boards.

In the early 2000s I've been also a **D**igital **S**ignal **P**rocessing (**DSP**) assistant teacher at
_Politecnico di Milano_. I can say I've been a data scientist since then, long before the term Data Science became commonly used.
Data science evolved in the years and I evolved together with it.

My github repositories contain experiments that I don't want to loose and some more serious project I worked or I'm
working on.
